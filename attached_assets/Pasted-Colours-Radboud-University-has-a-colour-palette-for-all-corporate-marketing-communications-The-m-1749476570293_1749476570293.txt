Secondary colours
The red gamut is leading in colour use. But when the main colours are not sufficient, for example in illustrations, banners or graphics, you can use the secondary colour palette for detailing. In doing so, always stay within the colour's own shades. Do not use complementary colours on top of each other.

Please note!
It is not permitted for faculties or divisions of the university to appropriate a colour from the red range or the secondary colour palette. We communicate as one strong brand and therefore all use the Red Impact as the main colour, with complementary shades of red to support it.
