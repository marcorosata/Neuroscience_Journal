üîß FOR REAL-TIME WEB (Three.js / WebGL / WebGPU)
Use a physically-inspired but optimized model that balances performance and realism.

1. Lightning in Three.js
Method: Use fractal noise + line segments + shader-based glow.

Approach: Implement a Lichtenberg fractal tree with recursive branching + GLSL postprocessing (bloom, glow).

Library: three-nebula for particle systems or three-lightning for simpler setups.

GPU-powered option: Combine with postprocessing.js to get bloom/glow/compositing.

Code sketch (Three.js lightning bolt):

Modifica
import * as THREE from 'three';

// Simple lightning bolt geometry (can be replaced with fractal)
const lightningMaterial = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({ color: 0x99ccff });
const lightningGeometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry().setFromPoints([
  new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0),
  new THREE.Vector3(0.5, -1, 0),
  new THREE.Vector3(-0.2, -2, 0),
]);

const lightningBolt = new THREE.Line(lightningGeometry, lightningMaterial);
scene.add(lightningBolt);
Enhance it with noise/displacement shaders, bloom, or volumetric effects.

üé® FOR ULTRAREALISTIC RENDERING (Blender / Unity HDRP / Unreal Engine)
If you're not limited to the browser, use a physically accurate simulation + path-traced rendering.

2. Blender + Geometry Nodes
Generate branching lightning paths procedurally with Geometry Nodes.

Use emission shaders and volumetric fog for glow and atmospheric scattering.

3. Unreal Engine 5 (Lumen + Niagara FX)
Use Niagara for procedural electricity and control sparks, glow, and bolt behavior.

Integrate with Lumen's global illumination and volumetric clouds for stunning cinematic shots.

4. Unity HDRP + VFX Graph
Use Unity‚Äôs Visual Effect Graph to create fractal lightning arcs with glowing particles, electric discharges, and real-time post-processing.

üß† AI GENERATIVE LIGHTNING (If you want to generate ultra-realistic stills or video)
Stable Diffusion + ControlNet (Depth or Scribble): Prompt-guided lightning generation.

Runway / Kaiber / Pika: For video animation of lightning bolts with motion.

Prompt example:

‚ÄúHyperrealistic lightning bolt striking a forest, cinematic lighting, volumetric fog, photorealism, 8K, global illumination, Unreal Engine style‚Äù

‚ö°Ô∏è Physics-Based Simulation (Advanced, for scientific/realistic visuals)
If you want real plasma behavior:

Use fractal Brownian motion (fBm) for bolt branching.

Solve leader propagation paths with dielectric breakdown models.

Research-based papers: ‚ÄúFractal models of lightning‚Äù and ‚ÄúLaplacian growth for electric discharge modeling‚Äù.

Could be implemented offline or visualized via WebGPU + compute shaders.
